== What's New in 3.1 Since 3.0
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

This section covers the changes made from version 3.0 to version 3.1.
For changes in earlier version, see xref:appendix/change-history.adoc[Change History].

[[x31-kafka-client]]
=== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 3.5.1 `kafka-clients`.

[[x31-ekb]]
=== EmbeddedKafkaBroker

An additional implementation is now provided to use `Kraft` instead of Zookeeper.
See <<ekb>> for more information.

[[x31-jd]]
=== JsonDeserializer

When a deserialization exception occurs, the `SerializationException` message no longer contains the data with the form `Can't deserialize data [[123, 34, 98, 97, 122, ...`; an array of numerical values for each data byte is not useful and can be verbose for large data.
When used with an `ErrorHandlingDeserializer`, the `DeserializationException` sent to the error handler contains the `data` property which contains the raw data that could not be deserialized.
When not used with an `ErrorHandlingDeserializer`, the `KafkaConsumer` will continually emit exceptions for the same record showing the topic/partition/offset and the cause thrown by Jackson.
