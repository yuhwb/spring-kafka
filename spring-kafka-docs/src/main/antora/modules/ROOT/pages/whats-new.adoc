== What's New in 3.2 Since 3.1
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

This section covers the changes made from version 3.1 to version 3.2.
For changes in earlier version, see xref:appendix/change-history.adoc[Change History].

[[x32-kafka-client-version]]
=== Kafka Client Version

This version requires 3.7.0 `kafka-clients`.
The 3.7.0 version of Kafka client introduces the new consumer group protocol.
Fore more details and it's limitations see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/The+Next+Generation+of+the+Consumer+Rebalance+Protocol+%28KIP-848%29+-+Early+Access+Release+Notes[KIP-848].
The new consumer group protocol is an early access release and not meant to be used in production.
It is only recommended to use for testing purposes in this version.
Therefore, Spring for Apache Kafka supports this new consumer group protocol only to the extent of such testing level support available in the `kafka-client` itself.
By default, Spring for Apache Kafka uses the classic consumer group protocol and when testing the new consumer group protocol, that needs to be opted-in via the `group.protocol` property on the consumer.

[[x32-testing-support-changes]]
=== Testing Support Changes

The `kraft` mode is disabled in `EmbeddedKafka` by default and users wanting to use the `kraft` mode must enable it.
This is due to certain instabilities observed while using `EmbeddedKafka` in `kraft` mode, especially when testing the new consumer group protocol.
The new consumer group protocol is only supported in `kraft` mode and because of this, when testing the new protocol, that needs to be done against a real Kafka cluster and not the one based on the `KafkaClusterTestKit`, which `EmbeddedKafka` is based upon.
In addition, there were some other race conditions observed, while running multiple `KafkaListener` methods with `EmbeddedKafka` in `kraft` mode.
Until these issues are resolved, the `kraft` default on `EmbeddedKafka` will remain as `false`.

[[x32-kafka-streams-iqs-support]]
=== Kafka Streams Interactive Query Support

A new API `KafkaStreamsInteractiveQuerySupport` for accessing queryable stores used in Kafka Streams interactive queries.
See xref:streams.adoc#kafka-streams-iq-support[Kafka Streams Interactive Support] for more details.

[[x32-tiss]]
=== TransactionIdSuffixStrategy

A new `TransactionIdSuffixStrategy` interface was introduced to manage `transactional.id` suffix.
The default implementation is `DefaultTransactionIdSuffixStrategy` when setting `maxCache` greater than zero can reuse `transactional.id` within a specific range, otherwise suffixes will be generated on the fly by incrementing a counter.
See xref:kafka/transactions.adoc#transaction-id-suffix-fixed[Fixed TransactionIdSuffix] for more information.

[[x32-async-return]]
=== Async @KafkaListener Return

`@KafkaListener` (and `@KafkaHandler`) methods can now return asynchronous return types include `CompletableFuture<?>`, `Mono<?>` and Kotlin `suspend` functions.
See xref:kafka/receiving-messages/async-returns.adoc[Async Returns] for more information.

[[x32-customizable-dlt-routing]]
=== Routing of messages to custom DLTs based on thrown exceptions

It's now possible to redirect messages to the custom DLTs based on the type of the exception, which has been thrown during the message processing.
Rules for the redirection are set either via the `RetryableTopic.exceptionBasedDltRouting` or the `RetryTopicConfigurationBuilder.dltRoutingRules`.
Custom DLTs are created automatically as well as other retry and dead-letter topics.
See xref:retrytopic/features.adoc#exc-based-custom-dlt-routing[Routing of messages to custom DLTs based on thrown exceptions] for more information.

[[x32-cp-ptm]]
=== Deprecating ContainerProperties transactionManager property

Deprecating the `transactionManager` property in `ContainerProperties` in favor of `KafkaAwareTransactionManager`,  a narrower type compared to the general `PlatformTransactionManager`. See xref:kafka/container-props.adoc#kafkaAwareTransactionManager[ContainerProperties] and xref:kafka/transactions.adoc#transaction-synchronization[Transaction Synchronization].

[[x32-after-rollback-processing]]
=== After Rollback Processing

A new `AfterRollbackProcessor` API `processBatch` is provided.
See xref:kafka/annotation-error-handling.adoc#after-rollback[After-rollback Processor] for more information.

[[x32-retry-topic]]
=== Change @RetryableTopic SameIntervalTopicReuseStrategy default value
Change `@RetryableTopic` property `SameIntervalTopicReuseStrategy` default value to `SINGLE_TOPIC`.
See xref:retrytopic/topic-naming.adoc#single-topic-maxinterval-delay[Single Topic for maxInterval Exponential Delay].

=== Non-blocking retries support class level @KafkaListener
Non-blocking retries support xref:kafka/receiving-messages/class-level-kafkalistener.adoc[@KafkaListener on a Class].
See xref:retrytopic.adoc[Non-Blocking Retries].

=== Support process @RetryableTopic on a class in RetryTopicConfigurationProvider.
Provides a new public API to find `RetryTopicConfiguration`.
See xref:retrytopic/retry-config.adoc#find-retry-topic-config[Find RetryTopicConfiguration]

=== RetryTopicConfigurer support process MultiMethodKafkaListenerEndpoint.
The `RetryTopicConfigurer` support process and register `MultiMethodKafkaListenerEndpoint`.
The `MultiMethodKafkaListenerEndpoint` provides `getter/setter` for properties `defaultMethod` and `methods`.
Modify the `EndpointCustomizer` that strictly for `MethodKafkaListenerEndpoint` types.
The `EndpointHandlerMethod` add new constructors construct an instance for the provided bean.
Provides new class `EndpointHandlerMultiMethod` to handler multi method for retrying endpoints.

[[x32-seek-offset-compute-fn]]
=== New API method to seek to an offset based on a user provided function
`ConsumerCallback` provides a new API to seek to an offset based on a user-defined function, which takes the current offset in the consumer as an argument.
See xref:kafka/seek.adoc#seek[Seek API Docs] for more details.

[[x32-annotation-partition-offset-seek-position]]
=== @PartitionOffset support for SeekPosition
Adding `seekPosition` property to `@PartitionOffset` support for `TopicPartitionOffset.SeekPosition`.
See xref:kafka/receiving-messages/listener-annotation.adoc#manual-assignment[manual-assignment] for more details.

[[x32-topic-partition-offset-constructor]]
=== New constructor in TopicPartitionOffset that accepts a function to compute the offset to seek to
`TopicPartitionOffset` has a new constructor that takes a user-provided function to compute the offset to seek to.
When this constructor is used, the framework calls the function with the input argument of the current consumer offset position.
See xref:kafka/seek.adoc#seek[Seek API Docs] for more details.

[[x32-default-clientid-prefix]]
=== Spring Boot application name as default client ID prefix

For Spring Boot applications which define an application name, this name is now used
as a default prefix for auto-generated client IDs for certain client types.
See xref:kafka/connecting.adoc#default-client-id-prefixes[Default client ID prefixes] for more details.

[[get-listener-containers-matching]]
== Enhanced Retrieval of MessageListenerContainers

`ListenerContainerRegistry` provides two new API's dynamically find and filter `MessageListenerContainer` instances.
`getListenerContainersMatching(Predicate<String> idMatcher)` to filter by ID and the other is
`getListenerContainersMatching(BiPredicate<String, MessageListenerContainer> matcher)` to filter by ID and container properties.

See xref:kafka/receiving-messages/kafkalistener-lifecycle.adoc#retrieving-message-listener-containers[`@KafkaListener` Lifecycle Management's API Docs] for more information.

[[x32-observation]]
== Enhanced observation by providing more tracing tags

`KafkaTemplateObservation` provides more tracing tags(low cardinality).
`KafkaListenerObservation` provides a new API to find high cardinality key names and more tracing tags(high or low cardinality).
See xref:kafka/micrometer.adoc#observation[Micrometer Observation]
